**PlantUML** is an open-source tool allowing users to easily create UML Diagrams from simple textual description.

●  Create UML diagrams on the fly, with support for the PlantUML markup language.
●  Share quick sketches of concepts with your fellow programmers, available as inline query too, so that changes are visible in real time.
●  Quickly create sequence diagrams as PlantUML makes very complex diagrams from few lines of "code".

**Diagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive language.** [See PlantUML Language Reference Guide](http://plantuml.com/PlantUML_Language_Reference_Guide.pdf). **Images** can be generated in PNG, [in SVG](http://plantuml.com/svg) or [in LaTeX](http://plantuml.com/latex) format. It is also possible to generate [ASCII art diagrams](http://plantuml.com/ascii-art) (only for sequence diagrams).
